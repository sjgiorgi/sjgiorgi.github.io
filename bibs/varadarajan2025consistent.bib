    abstract = "In recent years, the proliferation of chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude has led to an increasing volume of AI-generated text. While the text itself is convincingly coherent and human-like, the variety of expressed of human attributes may still be limited. Using theoretical individual differences, the fundamental psychological traits which distinguish people, this study reveals a distinctive characteristic of such content: AI-generations exhibit remarkably limited variation in inferrable psychological traits compared to human-authored texts. We present a review and study across multiple datasets spanning various domains. We find that AI-generated text consistently models the authorship of an {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} human with such little variation that, on aggregate, it is clearly distinguishable from human-written texts using unsupervised methods (i.e., without using ground truth labels). Our results show that (1) fundamental human traits are able to accurately distinguish human- and machine-generated text and (2) current generation capabilities fail to capture a diverse range of human traits"
