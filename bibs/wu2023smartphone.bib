    abstract = "We present the AWARE-text package, an open-source software package for collecting textual data on Android mobile devices. This package allows for collecting short message service (SMS or text messages) and character-level keystrokes. In addition to collecting this raw data, AWARE-text is designed for on device lexicon processing, which allows one to collect standard textual-based measures (e.g., sentiment, emotions, and topics) without collecting the underlying raw textual data. This is especially important in the case of mobile phones, which can contain sensitive and identifying information. Thus, the AWARE-text package allows for privacy protection while simultaneously collecting textual information at multiple levels of granularity: person (lifetime history of SMS), conversation (both sides of SMS conversations and group chats), message (single SMS), and character (individual keystrokes entered across applications). Finally, the unique processing environment of mobile devices opens up several methodological and privacy issues, which we discuss.",
